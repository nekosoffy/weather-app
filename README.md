A project that utilizes the [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) Weather Data API to provide comprehensive weather information. Users can specify a location by entering their city, state, country, or other relevant detail, and receive current data on temperature, rain probability, wind speed, and an overall climate conditions description.

The application offers a 7-day forecast, allowing users to select which day's data they wish to view. Additionally, users can easily switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature readings, enhancing the overall experience.
