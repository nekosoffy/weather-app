A project that utilizes the [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) Weather Data API to provide comprehensive weather information. Users can specify a location by entering their city, state, country, or other relevant detail, and receive current data on temperature, rain probability, wind speed, and an overall climate conditions description.

The application also offers a 7-day forecast, allowing users to select which day's data they wish to view, with a webpage layout that works accross different devices. Additionally, users can easily switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature readings.
